# J2CL Protobuf  &middot; [![Build Status](https://github.com/google/j2cl-protobuf/actions/workflows/ci.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/google/j2cl-protobuf/actions/workflows/ci.yaml)

This repository contains [J2CL](http://j2cl.io) compatible implementation of
[Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers).

J2CL protobuf implementation emulates and closely follows most of the official
Java APIs to help share your Java code in different platforms.
The implementation is also well optimized for Web. It doesn't use reflection and
provides seamless communication between Java and JavaScript by sharing the same
underlying protobuf object instances.
